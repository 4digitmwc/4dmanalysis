# Outlier Detection for Rank Restricted Rhythm Game Tournaments

## Project Description

This is a project for analysis of [4 Digit MWC 4](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/4DM/4) Player Scores from Qualifiers to Grand Finals. This will include the Exploratory Data Analysis, Predicting the missing scores and Outlier Detection (or in other words, `Skillbanning`).

---

## Important Definitions

`4 digits` - An osu!mania player who has the 4k rank of 1000 to 9999

`Derankers` - A 4 digits whose skill exceeds the 4 digits skill level

`Skillbanning` - A method to select or classify the Derankers

`Beatmap Type` - A type of a beatmap, in the dataset it's labelled as `RC`, `HB`, `LN`, `SV` and `TB`. In this study we will omit the `SV` since it is not a physical skill

## Limitations

This project will limit to only 4dm4 Tournament Scores from the Official Multiplayer Links. The data was collected in the statistics sheet and it can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ahkEH9dOcpeAWHYfpUOKo_0AjD_aIOYzmsa8fKfGBAs/edit?rm=minimal#gid=254546040). However the dataset will be uploaded on Kaggle soon if HowToPlayLN is not lazy.

This project will soon expand to ranked and loved maps but after we finish the analysis on the tournament scores.

### Message to Collaborator(s)

To : Poly

When I wrote the current challenges, I realized this is beyond scope of my understanding a lot. Imagine actually analyzing data from small sample size (yes, small) and trying to understand what the model yields, or even actually building statistical models from scratch. If we successfully conclude this job, we probably can even do any real world data we wish to do with our magic.

I think this will be the most challenging job we have to do so in the osu!mania scene so far. I'm looking forward to learn and discuss with you. You are really smart and I believe we can do something to contribute the osu!mania community. Thank you for joining me and have fun with your work. (and don't forget to take a break as well as it is important to you)
